For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV Eles and use the CSV Ele data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV Ele data into a Postgres database.
